            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Army yet keeps the field at <hi>Donerayle</hi> or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, where, as I have heard, we cannot make a thousand fighting men; and they have lying about them or very neere them fifteene thousand at least. About six daies since Sir <hi>John Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> came from thence with seven or eight Collours some of them had but fifteene men, none of them passing fiftie, and most of them sicke and weake, the intent as I understand was to Garrison in <hi>Corke,</hi> and to carry the sound men into the field. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout halfe way from <hi>Mallow</hi> they were set upon by the Rebels, who were many in number had 500. Fire-lockes and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Horse set upon ours about breake
<pb facs="tcp:156075:3"/> of day, where they had been incamped all night; Sir <hi>John Panlet</hi> bestirred himselfe with judgement and valour, and the rest of the Commanders did their parts, made a daring shew of a weake substance; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though most of our men by reason of the excessive raine all that night could not light their Matches, but it pleased God after the first encounter, the Rebels like themselves runne away; we lost three men, Sir <hi>John Paulet</hi> was shot into the thigh, but we hope there is no danger of his life; but of this Sir <hi>Willam Oagle</hi> whom I heare is gone for <hi>England,</hi> can give the best relation. It is a lamentable thing that in all this time we should not have Forces nor meanes to be masters of the Field; one fix or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, well ordered, and one thousand or fifteene hundred Horse, with Money to keepe them in good order, and provide necessaries to keep them in health, would drive this rebellious crew headlong into the sea: but it seemes it is not Gods will, his worke is not yet finished, we are not yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently humbled.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:156075:3"/>
               <p>I had almost forgotten to advise you, that since my last, the Rebels besieged Sir <hi>Richard Osborne</hi> in his Castle neere <hi>Donger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van:</hi> the Lord <hi>Broughall</hi> with his owne and part of the Lord <hi>Barrymores</hi> Forces went to relieve them, removed the siege, and kild at least two hundred of them, without the losse of above one or two at most.</p>
               <p>Likewise one <hi>Williams</hi> that married a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Mr. <hi>Jonas Stowels,</hi> and in these late times was one of my Lord Presidents Troop, was taken prisoner and condemned to suffer, was sent with seven of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the next Tree to be hanged, and having brought him to the place they stript him starke mother-naked, and serching his cloathes for monies, found about 18. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but disagreed upon the division; whereupon it pleased God to direct and encourage him, fastned upon one of their Swords, wounded and killed most of them, and made an escape, he lay hidden by day and travelled by night, found three or foure sheeps-skins to hide part of his nakednesse, and was three daies before he could recover the Army, he was tired and almost famished,
<pb facs="tcp:156075:4"/> but the worst is past, and in short time he will recover. Thus doth God daily manifest his goodnesse among us.</p>
